Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Alexandra Moreno- Github seems overly complicated at first but I can see how it can be beneficial when coders are collaborating. It definitely is nice seeing changes instantly to code. 















Thaying Xiong - Github, the social media for coders. Neat how anyone can collaborate and give feedback.
